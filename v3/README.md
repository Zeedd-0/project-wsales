. !!! wanted to create a way to update and create duplicate objects so donÂ´t need to write in html so much.
      know can do it with innerHTMl and document.createElement + appendChild.
      for innerHTML, saw there is a suggestion not to use for security purposes,
      for document.createElement, thought it would be so much work because of the tables strucures.
      looking for other way to do it, saw can achieve with some frameworks, but since I haven't started
      studying frameworks, decided to go with what I got for now.
      after study frameworks, will refactor it so can have less stuff on html.
